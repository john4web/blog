## Hello and welcome to my blog! 😄

My name is Johannes Gerstbauer, and I am a passionate software developer from Vienna/Austria, with a special focus on object-oriented programming (OOP) in Java. For many years, I have been fascinated by the art of solving complex problems through elegant code, and I want to share this fascination with you here on my blog.

## My Job 🚀
Currently, I work as a JVM Backend Developer at ["Karriere.at"](https://karriere.at), an Austrian career portal and online job board. The tech stack I work with includes Kotlin, Java, Spring Boot, and MySQL.

## My Background 🎓
My journey into the world of software development began in 2014 when I first designed a Java application in school. Since then, I have continuously educated myself and deepened my knowledge in full-stack web development. During my Bachelor’s degree in "Media Technology" and my Master’s degree in "Interactive Media," I dealt with various technologies in the frontend and backend of web applications (PHP, Laravel, JavaScript, Vue.js, HTML, CSS, ...). After my studies, I focused more on backend development, and currently, Java and OOP form the core of my work.

## Why this Blog? 📝
This blog was created out of a desire to share my knowledge and experiences with like-minded individuals. Additionally, it serves as an interesting reference for myself on topics I have already explored. Here, you will find articles that delve into the intricacies of object-oriented programming, software design patterns, clean code, fundamental programming principles, and the many facets of Java.

## Inspiration from Books 📚
Many of the topics I cover in this blog are inspired by books I have read that have shaped my journey as a developer. Classics like "Clean Code" by Robert C. Martin, "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" by Erich Gamma and others, as well as "The Pragmatic Programmer" by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas, have provided me with valuable insights that I want to share with you here.

## Off the Keyboard 🎸
In my free time, I love unwinding with a game of chess to stimulate my mind or grabbing my electric guitar to escape the daily grind with a few riffs.
