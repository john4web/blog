<p>This blog article explores the keyword <code>null</code>, a staple in every programmer&rsquo;s daily work. Should we reconsider the use of null references in our software? Could encountering <code>null</code> in our code actually be harmful? This article aims to address these questions and provide insight into the implications of using <code>null</code>.</p>

<p>To understand why <code>null</code> exists at all, we must travel back to 1965, when the null reference was invented by Tony Hoare. In a renowned lecture in 2009, while accepting the Turing Award, Hoare famously referred to the creation of null references as his <em>&ldquo;billion-dollar mistake&rdquo;</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I call it my billion-dollar mistake. It was the invention of the null reference in 1965. At that time, I was designing the first comprehensive type system for references in an object oriented language (ALGOL W). My goal was to ensure that all use of references should be absolutely safe, with checking performed automatically by the compiler. But I couldn&rsquo;t resist the temptation to put in a null reference, simply because it was so easy to implement. This has led to innumerable errors, vulnerabilities, and system crashes, which have probably caused a billion dollars of pain and damage in the last forty years.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->

</blockquote>
<p>Null references are a common source of software errors, such as null pointer exceptions, which can cause system crashes and security issues. When Tony Hoare introduced null references, his motivation was practical: it seemed like a simple way to indicate that a reference didn&rsquo;t have a valid value. However, this seemingly straightforward choice has had lasting consequences, resulting in decades of costly bug fixes and the need for complex security measures. Looking back, Hoare expressed regret for his decision, admitting that he couldn&rsquo;t have foreseen the problems it would create. Today, his opinion on null references is clear:</p>

<p>Null references have been a historically bad idea.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->

<p>Who is Tony Hoare? Tony Hoare is a British computer scientist who gained widespread recognition for his contributions to the field. He is best known for creating the <em>Quicksort algorithm</em>, one of the most efficient sorting methods, and <em>Hoare logic</em>, which allows the correctness of algorithms to be proven. He also developed a process algebra that influenced programming languages like Ada, Occam, and Go. In 1980, Hoare received the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_Award"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Turing Award</a>, often referred to as the &ldquo;Nobel Prize of Computer Science&rdquo;, for his work on the definition and design of programming languages.</p>

<p>Why do I mention all of this? Because when a luminary in computer science like Tony Hoare declares, that null references are a bad idea, it carries significant weight — particularly given that he himself was the one who introduced them. And he is not alone in his opinion. As Hoare noted in his <a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Null-References-The-Billion-Dollar-Mistake-Tony-Hoare/"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Turing Award lecture</a>, Edsger W. Dijkstra also regarded null references as a bad idea.</p>

<p>Dijkstra was another luminary in the field of computer science. He was a pioneer of structured programming and famous for the <em>Dijkstra&rsquo;s algorithm</em>. In 1972, he received the Turing Award as well. Dijkstra used humor to illustrate the problem with null references in programming. In a metaphor, he described objects as bachelors and <code>null</code> as a person: <em>&ldquo;If you have a null reference, then every bachelor who you represent in your object structure will seem to be married polyandrously to the same person Null&rdquo;</em>.</p>
<p>If you search the internet, you&rsquo;ll find many people who view the use of null references as bad coding practice. One of them is <a href="https://www.yegor256.com/about-me.html"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yegor Bugayenko</a>. In his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3aNJX7AP3M"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video on null references</a>, Yegor presents insightful, practical code examples that highlight the issues associated with working with null values, while also offering effective solutions. The following chapters summarize Yegor Bugayenko&rsquo;s video and his perspectives on null references:</p>

<p>The following code snippet shows a method that fetches an employee object from a database:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="kd">public</span> <span class="n">Employee</span> <span class="nf">getByName</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">String</span> <span class="n">name</span><span class="o">){</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">id</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">database</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">find</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="o">);</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    <span class="k">if</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">id</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="o">){</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="kc">null</span><span class="o">;</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    <span class="o">}</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">Employee</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">id</span><span class="o">);</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="o">}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>If the database does not find the employee, the method returns <code>null</code> instead of returning an instance of <code>Employee</code>.
This is terribly wrong! <strong>But why?</strong> Here, I present you 9 reasons why this is terribly wrong:</p>
<p><strong>1. Because it may cause many nullpointer exceptions in the code.</strong></p>
<p>For example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="n">getByName</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">&#34;Jeffrey&#34;</span><span class="o">).</span><span class="na">salary</span><span class="o">();</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>If there is no employee with the name &ldquo;Jeffrey&rdquo; in the database, then the above code throws a nullpointer exception.</p>
<p>There is no such thing as:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="kc">null</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">salary</span><span class="o">();</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p><strong>2. Because it is technically difficult to trace the causes of nullpointer exceptions.</strong></p>
<p>Most of the time, there is a lack of context in stack traces. Usually, the stack trace points to the line where the nullpointer exception happened but not to the specific variable or expression that was <code>null</code>. Modern programs with complex and nested code structures, with delayed execution and with lambdas make it even harder to debug.</p>
<p><strong>3. Because null references destroy our trust to the objects we are working with.</strong></p>
<p>When we do not use <code>null</code> in our code, we can trust, that objects will be objects. We can trust that objects will look like objects and that objects will behave like objects. However, when we introduce null references into our code, then we cannot trust our objects anymore. They are no longer reliable or self-sufficient.</p>
<p>Let’s assume we have a method that claims to return an object. If this method unexpectedly returns something that isn’t an object, it disrupts our entire reasoning. We can no longer be certain about what is <code>null</code> and what is not <code>null</code>, leaving us in a state of uncertainty.</p>
<p>Then we start to suspect all objects that they are no objects anymore, even though they might actually still be. We suspect all the variables and everything that we are working with that it is not good enough. We cannot know whether we can &ldquo;touch&rdquo; the variables or not because they could be <code>null</code> and then the code breaks if we try to access them. In this way objects are not real objects anymore and they are not following the contract we are expecting.</p>
<p><strong>4. Because you have to insert countless null checks in your code.</strong></p>
<p>The previously mentioned trust issues bring another disadvantage: You <strong>always</strong> have to check if variables are <code>null</code> before you can do something with them. You have to add those null-checks <strong>everywhere</strong> to make sure that your program works reliable and avoids NullpointerExceptions. In this way, the code base grows and grows and the methods/classes become longer and longer. The code becomes cluttered, unclear and hard to understand/maintain. This is the opposite of the &ldquo;Clean Code&rdquo; approach!</p>
<p><strong>5. Because null references violate the core idea of encapsulation.</strong></p>
<p>When a method can return <code>null</code> instead of an actual object, the calling code must explicitly check for <code>null</code> to avoid exceptions. This shifts the responsibility of managing the object&rsquo;s internal state to the external code. For example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="n">Object</span> <span class="n">obj</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">someMethod</span><span class="o">();</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">obj</span> <span class="o">!=</span> <span class="kc">null</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    <span class="n">obj</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">doSomething</span><span class="o">();</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="o">}</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="o">{</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    <span class="c1">// Handle null case
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="c1"></span><span class="o">}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Instead of encapsulating behavior, the caller has to manage an exceptional case (<code>null</code>) that ideally should have been handled inside the object. In this way,null references violate encapsulation. Internal states are exposed and external code is forced to handle the consequences. This undermines the very essence of objects being self-contained and reliable entities. With proper encapsulation, objects manage their behavior internally and provide meaningful defaults or throw specific exceptions if something goes wrong. Returning <code>null</code> avoids this responsibility, leaving the caller to guess what went wrong or what to do next.</p>
<p><strong>6. Because null references are completely against the object oriented paradigm.</strong></p>
<p>Null references break encapsulation and the trust in objects. In OOP, objects should model Real-World-Concepts. <code>Null</code> however, does not represent anything meaningful in the real world. For instance, an object like <code>Car</code> represents a car, but <code>null</code> doesn’t represent &ldquo;no car&rdquo; in an intuitive way — it’s simply the absence of a reference.</p>
<p>In my opinion, polymorphism is <strong>the key principle of OOP</strong> (I explain why in <a href="https://gersti.at/posts/polymorphism/#the-pillars-of-oop"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this</a> article). However <code>null</code> even contradicts polymorphism. Polymorphism lets objects define how they behave using interfaces and inheritance. Null references break this because <code>null</code> doesn&rsquo;t have any behavior. <code>Null</code> can&rsquo;t inherit! <code>Null</code> can&rsquo;t implement interfaces!</p>
<p>Furthermore, introducing <code>null</code> often leads to procedural-style code, with if-statements checking for null scattered throughout the codebase. This undermines the OO principle of objects interacting through well-defined methods, making the code less modular and harder to maintain.</p>
<p><strong>7. Because <code>null</code> is an ancient concept that originated in low-level programming languages.</strong></p>
<p><code>Null</code> was originally introduced in languages that use pointers, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28programming_language%29"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">C</a> for instance. However, when programming in Java, we don&rsquo;t think about pointers or memory. Instead, we deal with objects and references. In <em>&ldquo;Object-Thinking&rdquo;</em>, we view objects as &ldquo;living organisms&rdquo; or &ldquo;creatures.&rdquo; The thinking is about objects, the messages you send to them, and the reactions they send back to us. But <code>null</code> doesn&rsquo;t have any reaction since it is not an object!</p>
<p><strong>8. Because a lot of computer viruses are designed to exploit null references.</strong></p>
<p>Those viruses hope that some software forgets to check the null references and that they can reach that part in the program.</p>
<p><strong>9. Because null spreads like a disease.</strong></p>
<p><code>Null</code> behaves like a disease in our applications. If we allow it to enter our software, it grows and eventually infects the entire code. For instance, if a method returns null, you have to insert null-checks for it. These checks spread as more methods interact with the null-returning method, leading to a domino effect. The need to protect against <code>null</code> infects every layer of the system. When one method allows <code>null</code> as a valid return value or parameter, others must follow suit.</p>
<p>What do these 9 reasons tell us? When it comes to <code>null</code>, there is no middle ground — it&rsquo;s either black or white. Using <code>null</code> means the code is flawed and needs refactoring. Avoiding <code>null</code> results in clean, reliable code.</p>

</h2>
<p>NNow we know, that null references are really bad and that they have to be avoided at all cost. But how? What should we use instead of null references? Yegor presents two alternatives:</p>
<h3 id="alternative-1-throw-a-custom-exception-instead-of-returning-null">
  Alternative #1: Throw a Custom Exception instead of returning <code>null</code>:

    <i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"></i>
    <span class="sr-only">Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h3>
<p>Given the above example, you could simply throw your own exception:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="kd">public</span> <span class="n">Employee</span> <span class="nf">getByName</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">String</span> <span class="n">name</span><span class="o">){</span>

</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">        <span class="k">throw</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">EmployeeNotFoundException</span><span class="o">(</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">            <span class="s">&#34;I&#39;m sorry, but the employee is not found&#34;</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">        <span class="o">)</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    <span class="o">}</span>

</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="o">}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Yegor&rsquo;s suggestion of throwing an exception also reminds me on the principle <em>&ldquo;Crash Early!&rdquo;</em>, which was formulated in the book <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pragmatic_Programmer"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Pragmatic Programmer</a></em> (on page 120-121). When your code encounters something that should have been impossible, the program is no longer reliable. Anything it does after that point becomes questionable, so it’s better to stop it as soon as possible. A program that has crashed, typically causes less harm than one that continues to run in a broken state.</p>
<h3 id="alternative-2-return-a-null-object-instead-of-null">
  Alternative #2: Return a Null-Object instead of <code>null</code>:

<p>You could use the so-called <em>&ldquo;Null Object Design Pattern&rdquo;</em>. Given the above example, this solution could look like that:</p>

This represents the absence of an animal and simply does nothing (see the makeSound() method). The big advantage is that this approach does not trigger a NullPointerException in your code. Of course, you could also throw a custom exception in the makeSound method of the NullAnimal:</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In this situation you might ask yourself: &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t a null object just delay the failure to a later point in the code?&rdquo;. And the answer is: Yes, definately! In this case we just delay the moment when the exception is thrown. But the advantage here is, that we as software engineers can &ldquo;control&rdquo; the process in this way. And we can throw meaningful exceptions on our own. Exceptions that contain better information on the failure scenario.</p>
<p><strong>These two alternatives (throwing custom exceptions and using Null-Objects) are the best ways to deal with null references!</strong></p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>An Optional is kind of a container including one or zero elements.</p>
<p>Using Optionals is not a good idea. Why? Because it is not a solution for null references. It is the same as null references. The optional container is not an Object by itself. It is just a temporary memory structure which holds a real object. You still have to check if the optional contains an employee or if it has no employee. It is something that is presented as the solution of the null reference problem but actually it is not. Es verschiebt das problem nur an einen späteren Ort im Code.</p>
<p>To sum up:
However in most situations probably Alternative#1 is the best solution: just throwing an exception immediately.
However the first two options (Custom Exceptions and Null-Objects) are the perfect solutions to the null reference problem. In most scenarios, just throwing a custom exception would be the best way to deal with it.</p>

<p>Kotlin has attempted to solve the problem by making variables either nullable or non-nullable. Types are non-nullable by default. If you want a variable to hold a null value, you must explicitly declare it as nullable using <code>?</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Why throw a custom exception when we could just let the NullPointerException occur? In the end, the result is the same, right?</strong></p>
<p>No! There is a big difference between a nullpointer exception raised by the system or a EmployeeNotFoundException thrown manually by us developers. The nullpointerexception is thrown by the JVM, which is outside of our developer&rsquo;s scope, which means we can&rsquo;t control it. But the EmployeeNotFoundException is thrown by our objects so we are in charge, we can control it, we encapsulate this behaviour. Our objects control it and not the java runtime environment. Furthermore, the EmployeeNotFoundException can contain a custom error message written by the developer which is alo important for understanding the whole situation.</p>
<p>However, it is important that the program flow should not be controlled via exceptions! This is a trap, that developers often fall for.</p>

<p><strong><code>Null</code> is fast and exceptions are slow (regarding code performance)</strong></p>
<p>The following two code snippets illustrate this argument. The argument is that the first code snippet is way less performant than the second code snippet.</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This is true. The second code snippet is way faster than the second one! Every exception thrown is a lot of effort for the compiler/runtime. The runtime has to collect information about what was the cause of the exception and where it was thrown, to build the stack trace, to prepare the information, to stop the program execution, to go to the exceptional flow, &hellip;</p>
<p>However the speed of the application is way less important of a modern software than the maintainability of it is. It is way more important to have a software that is easy to maintain, easy to understand, easy to form, easy to adapt and clean coded than the performance of it.</p>
<p>Using <code>null</code> is in most cases way faster than using exceptions. Using <code>null</code> will make the life of the computer more easy but it also makes the life of the developer harder and complexer. For companies it costs way more money to deal with an unmaintainable application than to buy new hardware resources that are more efficient/performant.</p>
<p>Btw. this is also exactly the thing that the whole <a href="#books" >Clean Architecture Book</a> taught me. Even on the first 12 pages of the book, Robert C. Martin explains the importance of maintainability and shows diagrams on how much money companies have lost because their software was not maintainable.</p>

<p><strong>Some classes are not suitable for creating a null object. For example the <code>String</code> class. it is final. When you have a method that is supposed to return a string, then you have no option to return a null class. Like a null string or something like that. In this case you have to either return a string or something else.</strong></p>
<p>Answer: This is a problem. It is not possible to use null objects everywhere. but if it is not possible - make it possible. for instance with a wrapper. You could wrap/decorate the String class. Introduce your own class &ldquo;Text&rdquo; for instance. For the representation of Null you could use your NoText class and for existing texts you could use the normal Text class.
But never ever use Null. Just because you could use null it does not mean that you have to do it. Dont let the designers of the java language change your way to think about objects and clean code. Even if java encourage you to use null - dont do it. Be stronger than java!</p>

<p>I hope you enjoyed my article about null references. Whether you&rsquo;re a fan or a critic of <code>null</code>, I’d like to leave you with one final thought: I believe it’s incredibly important to question common development practices that we usually take for granted. Some things, like the use of <code>null</code>, are often accepted by developers as a given. But just because something exists and is used by a lot of people doesn’t automatically mean that it’s a good thing. So next time you’re at the office, grab a coffee and chat with your fellow programmers — even about the overlooked aspects of programming. ☕😊</p>
